# Practicing_GIT

This .md file was created in a new branch called 'new-branch'. To create this branch I typed 'git checkout -b new-branch' new-branch is the name of it, you can choose whatever name you want.

## New commands learned: 

- git checkout -b _name_ ⇾ creates a new branch called _name_;
- git checkout _name_ ⇾ go to the branch called _name_;
- git branch ⇾ show me the branch where I'm using right now and show me the list of other branchs;
- git branch --show-current ⇾ show me the branch  where I'm using now;
- git branch -vv ⇾ show us more details about the activity.
